# ðŸ‘‹ Tl;dr
This is a simple Social Media application. Demand for short-form content has grown in recent years, so I've decided to experiment with the concept. This is a simple messaging application where the user is limited by the amount of words they can send at any one time - taking inspiration from applications such as Messenger, Signal, Telegram and Snapchat.
